# inertia

Inertia is an adapter for the [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/) library adapted for the Go.

The library is designed to feel natural and look nature to Go developers.
As such the API diverges from the reference implementation of Inertia in PHP.

Optionally, it provides an [opinionated framework](https://github.com/inoutgg/inertia-go/tree/main/inertiaframe) for building Inertia.js applications on top of the `http.ServeMux` router.

## Vite

This library bundles a minimal adapter for the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool available via `go.inout.gg/intertia/contrib/vite`.
